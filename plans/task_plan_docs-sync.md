# Task Plan: docs-sync

## Goal
- Sync docs with current minimal architecture (WebUI kept, minimal self-evolve).

## Scope
- Update docs/minimal-architecture.md and docs/minimal-implementation-plan.md.
- Verify docs/minimal-notes.md and docs/codex-exec-reference.md remain accurate.

## Steps
1. Refresh architecture doc (components, flows, storage, HTTP endpoints).
2. Align implementation plan with removed features and WebUI presence.
3. Re-scan remaining docs for mismatches.

## Status
- current: 3/3
- last_updated: 2026-01-27
