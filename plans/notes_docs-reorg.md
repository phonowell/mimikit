# Notes: docs reorg

## Context
- User requested reorganization of all ./docs and redistribution of information; thoroughness prioritized.
- Follow-up request: sync CLAUDE.md with new doc responsibilities.

## Decisions
- Keep existing filenames; update CLAUDE.md references only when requested.
- Distribution: plan=phases/scope; architecture=design+data+config+prompt; notes=objective/decisions/risks/ops; exec reference=CLI only.

## Risks
- Over-moving content could break mental model or links; cross-links added to mitigate.
