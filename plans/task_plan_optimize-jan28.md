# task_plan_optimize-jan28

## goal
- Propose 10 optimization items; implement top 5 ROI with minimal code changes in a new worktree.

## constraints
- No questions until completion.
- Minimal, elegant changes; avoid new tests unless debugging.
- Update plan progress each step; record decisions in notes.

## plan
1. Survey code paths for low-risk optimizations (config, worker, http, verify). [done]
2. Select 10 optimization items and pick top 5 ROI for implementation. [done]
3. Implement top 5 changes with minimal edits. [done]
4. Validate changes (basic typecheck or targeted sanity checks if needed). [done]
5. Run review-code-changes skill and summarize outcomes. [done]

## progress
- 5/5

## decisions
- Confirmation step skipped due to user instruction (no questions until done).
